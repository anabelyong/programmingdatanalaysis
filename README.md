# Programming & Data analysis
Programming and Data Analytics coursework Year 2 University of Edinburgh 

Checkpoint 1:
Write a Python program to calculate and print to the terminal the radius and surface area of a sphere from its volume.

Your program should:
1) Prompt for the volume of a sphere in mm3
2) Calculate and print out to the terminal the radius and the surface area of the sphere in m and m2 respectively in an understandable format.

Checkpoint 2: 
Write a Python program to read in the three floating point coefficients a, b and c of the quadratic equation.

Checkpoint 3:
Write a Python program to explore the behaviour of a damped simple harmonic oscillator for a range of damping coefficients. This involves writing a program to trace out the amplitude against time for a damped simple harmonic oscillator under a range of conditions.

Checkpoint 4:
Write a Python program to read in data from the supplied file for voltage ( V(t)) and current ( I(t)) and plot, via pyplot, the log power, being: 
p(t)=log(V(t)I(t))
where log is natural log to base e.

Your program should:
1) Prompt for the filename to be read.
2) Read in the required data from sample.txt file and display p(t) over the supplied range of t with suitable titles and axis labels.
3) You must use a function of the form logpower(voltage,current) to form the p(t), and a main() program

Checkpoint 5:
Write two Python programs to numerically analyse the path of a projectile under gravity and drag force. There are two tasks, one to display the trajectory and the second to display the relation between final kinetic energy and launch angle.
